___

#### 1. Multi-neuron and Multi-layer Perceptron Learning Models 
  

* Based on sample problems, developed a code to generate weights and bias for each iteration until convergence is achieved by cycling through the input vectors. ( [convergence_perceptron.m](convergence_perceptron.m) )

    | p1 | p2 | p3 | p4 |
    | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
    | 2	| 1	| -2 | -1 |
    | 2 | -2 | 2 | 1 |

     | Target values |
     | ------------- |
     | 0 |
     | 1 |
     | 0 |
     | 1 |

     Taking initial value as null for weight and bias, perceptron learning rule was applied and weights and bias were generated. W(0) = [0 0]<sup>T</sup> , b(0)=0.

    Weight values: w = [a b]<sup>T</sup>

   Results were generated by checking for convergence of the bias and weights, by checking for each vector to verify the learning rule.
