The final codes submitted as partial fulfillment of my summer project during 2018.

# Problem 1: Multi-neuron and Multi-layer Perceptron Learning Models
* Based on sample problems, developed a code to generate weights and bias for each iteration until convergence is achieved by cycling through the input vectors.

| p1 | p2 | p3 | p4 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 2	| 1	| -2 | -1 |
| 2 | -2 | 2 | 1 |

| Target values |
| ------------- |
| 0 |
| 1 |
| 0 |
| 1 |

* Taking initial value as null for weight and bias, perceptron learning rule was applied and weights and bias were generated. W(0) = [0 0]<sup>T</sup> , b(0)=0.

Weight values: w = [a b]<sup>T</sup>

* Results were generated by checking for convergence of the bias and weights, by checking for each vector to verify the learning rule.
