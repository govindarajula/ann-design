  * Also developed a time series forecasting model in Python by implementation of concepts from Hagan Demuth notes, studying results from various algorithms. ( [time series-ipynb code](time-series-practice-model.ipynb) )
  
  
  * Studied and designed models based on backpropagation, ADALINE networks. Developed a multi-layer model and used hidden layers as well to study their architecture and performance. ( [percep-hidden-layers code](multi_lay_percep_two_hidd_layers.ipynb) )
